# Java Tutorial

This java tutorial is not a tutorial that will teach you the language itself, it's the collection of code samples which 
can be used for better understanding ideas behind concepts of design patterns, data structures, algorithms. It assumes 
that you are already familiar with the language. Each topic has a small explanation of the problem or idea and the solution, 
you can use it as you wish and you want.

NOTE: The tutorial is not fully ready.

## [Design Patterns](design-patterns/README.md "The design patterns chapter")

In this tutorial the following design patterns will be described:

* Creational: [Abstract Factory](design-patterns/doc/abstract-factory.md "The abstract factory chapter"), 
[Builder](design-patterns/doc/builder.md "The builder chapter"), 
[Factory Method](design-patterns/doc/factory-method.md "The factory method chapter"), 
[Prototype](design-patterns/doc/prototype.md "The prototype chapter"), 
[Singleton](design-patterns/doc/singleton.md "The singleton chapter"); 
* Structural: [Adapter](design-patterns/doc/adapter.md "The adapter chapter"), 
[Bridge](design-patterns/doc/bridge.md "The bridge chapter"), 
[Composite](design-patterns/doc/composite.md "The composite chapter"),

[Flyweight](design-patterns/doc/flyweight.md "The flyweight chapter"), 
[Proxy](design-patterns/doc/proxy.md "The proxy chapter"); 
* Behavioral: Chain Of Responsibility, Commander, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, 
Template Method, Visitor.
