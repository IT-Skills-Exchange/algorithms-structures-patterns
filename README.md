# Java Tutorial

This tutorial is not a tutorial that intents teach you the language itself, it's a collection of code samples which 
can be used for better understanding ideas behind the concepts of design patterns, data structures and algorithms. 

It assumes that you are familiar with the language. 

Each topic has small explanation of a problem or an idea and the solution, you can use it as you wish and as you want.

As a start point, let's address to [Programming Principles](doc/programming-principles.md "Programming Principles").

## [Design Patterns](design-patterns/README.md "The design patterns chapter")

In the tutorial the following design patterns will be described:

* Creational Patterns: 
[Abstract Factory](design-patterns/doc/abstract-factory.md "The abstract factory chapter"), 
[Builder](design-patterns/doc/builder.md "The builder chapter"), 
[Factory Method](design-patterns/doc/factory-method.md "The factory method chapter"), 
[Prototype](design-patterns/doc/prototype.md "The prototype chapter"), 
[Singleton](design-patterns/doc/singleton.md "The singleton chapter"); 
* Structural Patterns: 
[Adapter](design-patterns/doc/adapter.md "The adapter chapter"), 
[Bridge](design-patterns/doc/bridge.md "The bridge chapter"), 
[Composite](design-patterns/doc/composite.md "The composite chapter"), 
[Decorator](design-patterns/doc/decorator.md "The decorator chapter"), 
[Facade](design-patterns/doc/facade.md "The facade chapter"), 
[Flyweight](design-patterns/doc/flyweight.md "The flyweight chapter"), 
[Proxy](design-patterns/doc/proxy.md "The proxy chapter"); 
* Behavioral Patterns: 
[Chain Of Responsibility](design-patterns/doc/chain-of-responsibility.md "The chain of responsibility chapter"), 
[Command](design-patterns/doc/command.md "The command chapter"), 
[Interpreter](design-patterns/doc/interpreter.md "The interpreter chapter"), 
[Iterator](design-patterns/doc/iterator.md "The iterator chapter"), 
[Mediator](design-patterns/doc/mediator.md "The mediator chapter"),
[Memento](design-patterns/doc/memento.md "The memento chapter"), 
[Observer](design-patterns/doc/observer.md "The observer chapter"), 
[State](design-patterns/doc/state.md "The state chapter"),
[Strategy](design-patterns/doc/strategy.md "The strategy chapter"), 
[Template Method](design-patterns/doc/template-method.md "The template method chapter"), 
[Visitor](design-patterns/doc/visitor.md "The visitor chapter").

## [Data Structures](data-structures/README.md "The data structures chapter")

In the tutorial the following data structures will be described:

* [Array](data-structures/doc/array.md "The array chapter")

## [Algorithms](algorithms/README.md "The algorithms chapter")

In the tutorial the following algorithms will be described:

* [Bubble Sort](algorithms/doc/bubble-sort.md "The bubble sort chapter")
* [Selection Sort](algorithms/doc/selection-sort.md "The selection sort chapter")
* [Insertion Sort](algorithms/doc/insertion-sort.md "The insertion sort chapter")
* [Shell Sort](algorithms/doc/shell-sort.md "The shell sort chapter")
* [Factorial](algorithms/doc/factorial.md "The factorial chapter")
* [Merge Sort](algorithms/doc/merge-sort.md "The merge sort chapter")
* [Quick Sort](algorithms/doc/quick-sort.md "The quick sort chapter")
