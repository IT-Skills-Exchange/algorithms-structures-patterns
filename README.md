# Algorithms Structures Patterns

This tutorial is not a tutorial that intents teach you the language itself, it's a collection of code samples which 
can be used for better understanding ideas behind the concepts of design patterns, data structures and algorithms. 

It assumes that you are familiar with the language. 

Each topic has small explanation of a problem or an idea and the solution, you can use it as you wish and as you want.

As a start point, let's address to [Programming Principles](doc/programming-principles.md "Programming Principles").

## [Design Patterns](design-patterns/README.md "The design patterns chapter")

In the tutorial the following design patterns will be described:

* Creational Patterns:

[Strategy](design-patterns/doc/strategy.md "The strategy chapter"), 
[Template Method](design-patterns/doc/template-method.md "The template method chapter"), 
[Visitor](design-patterns/doc/visitor.md "The visitor chapter").

## [Data Structures](data-structures/README.md "The data structures chapter")

In the tutorial the following data structures will be described:

* [Array](data-structures/doc/array.md "The array chapter")
* [List, Array List, Vector](data-structures/doc/list-array-list-vector.md "The list, array list, vector chapter")
* [Linked List](data-structures/doc/linked-list.md "The linked list chapter")
