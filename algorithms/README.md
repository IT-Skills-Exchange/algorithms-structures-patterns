# Algorithms

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable 
instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always unambiguous and 
are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.

As a start point, let's address to [Big-O Notation](doc/big-o-notation.md "Big-O Notation").

In the tutorial the following algorithms will be described:

* Sort Algorithms:

[Selection Sort](./doc/selection-sort.md "The selection sort chapter"),
[Insertion Sort](./doc/insertion-sort.md "The insertion sort chapter"),
[Shell Sort](./doc/shell-sort.md "The shell sort chapter"),
[Merge Sort](./doc/merge-sort.md "The merge sort chapter"),
[Quick Sort](./doc/quick-sort.md "The quick sort chapter"),
[Counting Sort](./doc/counting-sort.md "The counting sort chapter"),
[Radix Sort](./doc/radix-sort.md "The radix sort chapter"),
[Bucket Sort](./doc/bucket-sort.md "The bucket sort chapter");
* Search Algorithms:
