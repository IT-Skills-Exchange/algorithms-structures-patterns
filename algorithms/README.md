# Algorithms

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable 
instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always unambiguous and 
are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.
