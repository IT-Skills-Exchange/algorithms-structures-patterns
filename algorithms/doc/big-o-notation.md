# Big-O Notation

In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements 
grow as the input size grows. In analytic number theory, big O notation is often used to express a bound on 
the difference between an arithmetical function and a better understood approximation; a famous example of such 
a difference is the remainder term in the prime number theorem.
