# Big-O Notation

In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements 
grow as the input size grows. In analytic number theory, big O notation is often used to express a bound on 
the difference between an arithmetical function and a better understood approximation; a famous example of such 
a difference is the remainder term in the prime number theorem.

Big O notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates: different functions with the same growth rate 
may be represented using the same O notation.

The letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as the order of the function. 
A description of a function in terms of big O notation usually only provides an upper bound on the growth rate of 
the function. Associated with big O notation are several related notations, using the symbols o, Ω, ω, and Θ, 
to describe other kinds of bounds on asymptotic growth rates.
