# Data Structures

In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient 
access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, 
and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Abstract Data Type

- Does not dictate how the data is organized
- Dictates the operations you can perform
- Concrete data structure is usually a concrete class
- Abstract data type is usually an interface
