# Design Patterns

Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI, and Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work principles. Complexity and patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical extensibility.

## [Design Patterns](design-patterns/README.md "The design patterns chapter")

In this tutorial the following design patterns will be described:

* Creational: Abstract Factory, [Builder](./doc/builder.md "The builder chapter"), Factory Method, 
Prototype, [Singleton](./doc/singleton.md "The singleton chapter"); 
* Structural: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy; 
* Behavioral: Chain Of Responsibility, Commander, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, 
Template Method, Visitor.
