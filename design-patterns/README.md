# Design Patterns

Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing 
an application or system.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for 
coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI, and Do The Simplest Thing That 
Could Possibly Work principles. Complexity and patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for 
practical extensibility.
